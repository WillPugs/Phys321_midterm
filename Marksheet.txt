Q1
--
2/2 correct movie quote
2/2 git commands

Q2
--
4/4 correct git commands

Q3
--
a)
1/1 correct RA
1/1 correct DEC
b)
2/2 argument regarding northern hemisphere
2/2 argument regarding southern hemisphere
c)
1/1 conversion to Alt-Az
2/2 computing Betelgeuse's Alt over a reasonable time interval
1/1 realizing that the Sun's Alt is needed to answer this question.
2/2 computing the Sun's Alt.
2/2 realizing that the requirements are that Betelgeuse is above the horizon and that the Sun is below the horizon.
1/1 right number of hours per night (eyeballing is ok).

Q4
--
a)
1/1 saying that JWST can see dimmer things
2/2 for getting the right flux ratio (1 for right formula, 1 for right answer).
b)
3/3 calculating the HST and JWST absolute magnitudes as a function of redshift or distance (1 for formula,  each for each telescope)
3/3 converting to solar luminosities
4/4 plots (1 each: full credit for a "perfect" plot, subtract 0.5 for presentation issues or if there is some incorrectness in the plot)
c)
3/4 code (0.5 each for each of the steps)
2/2 multiplying number density by volume to get the number of galaxies
3/3 correct number of galaxies (0.5 for each type for each telescope)
2/2 general coding style for all of Q4

**************
Comments:
--The ideas are all correct, but the number densities were in *comoving* coordinates, so the luminosity distances needed to first be converted into comoving distances.

Q5
--
2/2 points for general idea about the key quantity to compute.
4/4 points for correctly plugging in appropriate numbers (whether directly or by writing out Bayes' theorem)
2/2 points for a good discussion about whether "free" is good.
4/4 points for further investigation and discussion of a different word.

Q6
--
2/2 points for realizing that this is an inference problem for $\lambda$ (e.g., writing out Bayes' theorem gets full credit, but if the work implicitly implies an understanding, that's ok too).
1/1 point for realizing that the likelihood function is the product of the likelihood functions of the individual points.
1/1 point for plugging in Poisson distribution for likelihood.
2/2 points for implementation of the likelihood.
2/2 points for correct posterior.
1/2 points for conclusion that it was probably Stephen selling the cakse.
0/2 points for some reasoning about the level of confidence.
2/2 general coding style for all of Q6

**************
Comments:
--It's not enough just to look at the raw values of the posterior. (Need to think about credibility regions etc.) For example, suppose we had a super narrow (but super tall) spike at lambda = 5, but most of the probability (i.e., the area under the curve) was between 7.9 and 8.1. What would we conclude then?
